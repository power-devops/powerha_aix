<p>Every community can be strengthened by a diverse variety of viewpoints, insights,
opinions, skillsets, and skill levels. However, with diversity comes the potential for
disagreement and miscommunication. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to ensure that
disagreements and differences of opinion are conducted respectfully and on their own
merits, without personal attacks or other behavior that might create an unsafe or
unwelcoming environment.</p>
<p>These policies are not designed to be a comprehensive set of Things You Cannot Do. We ask
that you treat your fellow community members with respect and courtesy, and in general,
Don’t Be A Jerk. This Code of Conduct is meant to be followed in spirit as much as in
letter and is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>All Ansible events and participants therein are governed by this Code of Conduct and
anti-harassment policy. We expect organizers to enforce these guidelines throughout all events,
and we expect attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers to help ensure a safe
environment for our whole community. Specifically, this Code of Conduct covers
participation in all Ansible-related forums and mailing lists, code and documentation
contributions, public chat (Matrix, IRC), private correspondence, and public meetings.</p>
<p>Ansible community members are…</p>
<p><strong>Considerate</strong></p>
<p>Contributions of every kind have far-ranging consequences. Just as your work depends on
the work of others, decisions you make surrounding your contributions to the Ansible
community will affect your fellow community members. You are strongly encouraged to take
those consequences into account while making decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Patient</strong></p>
<p>Asynchronous communication can come with its own frustrations, even in the most responsive
of communities. Please remember that our community is largely built on volunteered time,
and that questions, contributions, and requests for support may take some time to receive
a response. Repeated “bumps” or “reminders” in rapid succession are not good displays of
patience. Additionally, it is considered poor manners to ping a specific person with
general questions. Pose your question to the community as a whole, and wait patiently for
a response.</p>
<p><strong>Respectful</strong></p>
<p>Every community inevitably has disagreements, but remember that it is
possible to disagree respectfully and courteously. Disagreements are never an excuse for
rudeness, hostility, threatening behavior, abuse (verbal or physical), or personal attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Kind</strong></p>
<p>Everyone should feel welcome in the Ansible community, regardless of their background.
Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. Do not make or
post offensive comments related to skill level, gender, gender identity or expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
Sexualized images or imagery, real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression,
stalking, sustained disruption of activities, publishing the personal information of
others without explicit permission to do so, unwanted physical contact, and unwelcome
sexual attention are all strictly prohibited.  Additionally, you are encouraged not to
make assumptions about the background or identity of your fellow community members.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitive</strong></p>
<p>The only stupid question is the one that does not get asked. We
encourage our users to ask early and ask often. Rather than asking whether you can ask a
question (the answer is always yes!), instead, simply ask your question. You are
encouraged to provide as many specifics as possible. Code snippets in the form of Gists or
other paste site links are almost always needed in order to get the most helpful answers.
Refrain from pasting multiple lines of code directly into the chat channels - instead use
gist.github.com or another paste site to provide code snippets.</p>
<p><strong>Helpful</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible community is committed to being a welcoming environment for all users,
regardless of skill level. We were all beginners once upon a time, and our community
cannot grow without an environment where new users feel safe and comfortable asking questions.
It can become frustrating to answer the same questions repeatedly; however, community
members are expected to remain courteous and helpful to all users equally, regardless of
skill or knowledge level. Avoid providing responses that prioritize snideness and snark over
useful information. At the same time, everyone is expected to read the provided
documentation thoroughly. We are happy to answer questions, provide strategic guidance,
and suggest effective workflows, but we are not here to do your job for you.</p>
<section id="anti-harassment-policy">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2" role="doc-backlink">Anti-harassment policy</a><a class="headerlink" href="#anti-harassment-policy" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Harassment includes (but is not limited to) all of the following behaviors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Offensive comments related to gender (including gender expression and identity), age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, and religion</p></li>
<li><p>Derogatory terminology including words commonly known to be slurs</p></li>
<li><p>Posting sexualized images or imagery in public spaces</p></li>
<li><p>Deliberate intimidation</p></li>
<li><p>Stalking</p></li>
<li><p>Posting others’ personal information without explicit permission</p></li>
<li><p>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</p></li>
<li><p>Inappropriate physical contact</p></li>
<li><p>Unwelcome sexual attention</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should
not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Meetup organizing staff and
other volunteer organizers should not use sexualized attire or otherwise create a
sexualized environment at community events.</p>
<p>In addition to the behaviors outlined above, continuing to behave a certain way after you
have been asked to stop also constitutes harassment, even if that behavior is not
specifically outlined in this policy. It is considerate and respectful to stop doing
something after you have been asked to stop, and all community members are expected to
comply with such requests immediately.</p>

<section id="policy-violations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" role="doc-backlink">Policy violations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#policy-violations" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by
contacting <a class="reference external" href="mailto:codeofconduct&#37;&#52;&#48;ansible&#46;com">codeofconduct<span>&#64;</span>ansible<span>&#46;</span>com</a>, to anyone with administrative power in community chat (Admins or Moderators on Matrix, ops on IRC), or to the local organizers of an event. Meetup
organizers are encouraged to prominently display points of contact for reporting unacceptable
behavior at local events.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action
they deem appropriate. These actions may include but are not limited to warning the
offender, expelling the offender from the event, and barring the offender from future
community events.</p>
<p>Organizers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts to an alternate location, or otherwise assist those experiencing
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value the safety and well-being
of our community members and want everyone to feel welcome at our events, both online and
offline.</p>
<p>We expect all participants, organizers, speakers, and attendees to follow these policies at
all of our event venues and event-related social events.</p>
